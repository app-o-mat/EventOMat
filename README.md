# Nerd Summit Conference App

This is a fork of: https://github.com/loufranco/EventOMat, which is several years old. This project is probably better as a starting point for forking and creating an app for a different conference.  Just update the icons, name, and data sources.

You may use this project to use as a start for making a conference app. All of the code is MIT licensed.

The images are copyright [NERD Summit](http://nerdsummit.org) and are only in this project as a placeholder and for learning purposes. 

If you make an app using this code, replace all images.
